title: Basic Starter
category: bread
ingredients:
  - 2 lbs whole wheat flour
  - 2 lbs white bread flour
  - filtered water at room temperature
steps:
  - First, make a supply of 50/50 flour blend by combining the whole wheat and white bread flours in a large container.
  - Take about a half cup of the starter blend and mix it with filtered water to form a thick paste.
  - Cover the container with a clean kitchen towel and let it sit at room temperature for 2-3 days.
  - Once the mixture starts to bubble and ferment, discard 80% of it and feed the remaining mixture with more flour and water.
  - Repeat this process every day for about a week until the starter is bubbly, active, and has a slightly tangy aroma.
