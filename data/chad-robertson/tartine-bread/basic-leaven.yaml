title: Basic Leaven
category: bread
ingredients:
  - 200 g stater blend
  - 200 g water
  - 1 Tbl basic starter, discarding the rest
steps:
  - The night before you plan to make a dough, feed the 1 Tbl starter with 200g of water and 200g of the 50/50 flour blend. Mix well, cover, and let sit overnight in a cool place, around 65°F (18°C).
  - The next day, the leaven should be bubbly and active. To test if it's ready, drop a spoonful of the leaven into a bowl of water. If it floats, it's ready to use. If it sinks, let it sit for another hour or so and test again.
