ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
  - 1/2 cup butter, melted
  - 1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk
  - 2 cups (12 oz. pkg.) semi­sweet chocolate chips
  - 1 1/3 cups flaked coconut
  - 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

steps:
  - Preheat oven to 350°F. 
  - Coat 13 x 9­inch baking pan with no­stick cooking spray.
  - Combine graham cracker crumbs and butter in small bowl. Press into bottom of prepared pan. Pour sweetened condensed milk evenly over crumb mixture. Layer evenly with chocolate chips, coconut and nuts. Press down firmly with fork.
  - Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned. Loosen from sides of pan while still warm; cool on wire rack. Cut into bars or diamonds.
