category: cookies
notes: I remember my grandmother getting wonderfully ripe persimmons from friendly countryside neighbors who would leave their fruit out on a table and a box for the money, on the honor system.

ingredients:
  - 1 c persimmon pulp
  - 1 tsp baking soda
  - 1 1/2 c sugar
  - 1/2 c shortening
  - 1 egg
  - 2 1/4 c flour
  - 1/2 tsp cinnamon
  - 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
  - 1/2 tsp ground cloves
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1 c raisins (optional)

steps:
  - Preheat oven to 350F.
  - Mix baking soda with the persimmon pulp and set aside. The pulp will gel a bit.
  - Meanwhile, cream sugar and shortening a few minutes in the mixer until fluffy.
  - Add the persimmon gel to sugar mixture and mix on med.
  - Add the egg and continue mixing until well combined.
  - Sift together the dry ingredients and add them in slowly, reducing the speed to low once it comes together. Add the raisins and mix through.
  - Drop by teaspoons on baking sheets, either lightly oiled or on parchment paper.
  - Bake at 350 for 12 - 14 minutes.
  - Optional: Glaze with powder sugar glaze made with orange juice (or with water).
