  - 500g strong white bread flour

  - 7g instant yeast
  - 350ml warm water
steps:
  - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and yeast.

  - Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
  - Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
  - Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F) and place a baking tray inside to heat up.
  - Punch down the dough to release any air bubbles, then shape it into a round loaf.
  - Place the loaf onto the hot baking tray and make a few slashes on the top with a sharp knife.
  - Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
  - Remove from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.
